# Gatsby DevDoc Theme Example

An example usage of [gatsby-theme-devdoc](https://github.com/garoyeri/gatsby-theme-devdoc) with a few example pages to demonstrate the included components.

To get started, install NodeJS, then run:

```shell
npm install
npm run develop
```

The site will fire up on http://localhost:8000.

To build the site:

```shell
npm run build
# optionally:
npm run serve
```

The `build` target will compile the static site into the `public` folder that you can publish on your favorite static site hosting. The `serve` target will take the output in `public` and serve it up over http://localhost:9000 for you to try out.
